# Delivery Chart Board using NLP and PyTorch
Delivery Chart Board is a project aimed at automating the creation of delivery charts based on textual descriptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and PyTorch, a deep learning framework. The system processes textual descriptions of delivery tasks and converts them into graphical representations, providing a visual overview of the delivery schedule.

**Introduction**

The Delivery Chart Board project leverages NLP algorithms and PyTorch models to analyze and understand textual descriptions of delivery tasks. It extracts relevant information such as delivery dates, locations, and quantities from the text and translates it into a structured format suitable for visualization.

# Technologies Used
**Python:** The project is implemented in Python, a versatile programming language commonly used for machine learning and NLP tasks.
**PyTorch:** PyTorch is used for building and training neural network models for NLP tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition (NER), and sequence labeling.

**Matplotlib:** Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python used to create charts and visualizations. It is used to generate delivery charts based on the extracted information.
**Streamlit:** It is a web framework for Python used to create web applications. It can be used to create a web interface for users to input textual descriptions and view the corresponding delivery charts.
**Model Architecture**
The NLP model architecture for extracting delivery-related information typically involves the following components:

**Tokenizer:** Converts input text into numerical representations suitable for input to the neural network model.

**Transformer Encoder:** 
Processes the tokenized input text and generates contextual embeddings for each token.

**Task-Specific Head:** 
The final layer(s) of the model designed for the specific NLP task, such as named entity recognition (NER) or sequence labeling. It predicts the labels or categories associated with each token.

**Usage**
To use the Delivery Chart Board:

Input textual descriptions of delivery tasks into the system.
The system processes the input text using NLP techniques to extract delivery-related information.
Generate delivery charts based on the extracted information, visualizing the delivery schedule.
Optionally, deploy the system as a web application using Flask to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.
